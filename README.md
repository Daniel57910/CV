## Daniel Miller

Technology enthusiast and full stack developer in the making. My background demonstrates my strong sense of initiative, ability to learn concepts quickly and commitment to high quality work. 

I'm currently completing the Makers Academy course. Currently I'm focusing on ruby, but I'll be exposing myself to the full tech stack and software development best practices over the next three months. 

## Skills

#### Strong Communicator
Managed a cross functional team whilst working as a division head at the Innovation Enterprise. Prior to Makers Academy, I worked remotely as a business development and marketing contractor for a range of international clients. 
#### Entrepreneurial 
Began working as a freelancer whilst teaching English in Colombia. Obtained enough business to justify setting up a registered company and hired a full time employee to assist with project execution. 
#### Innovative 
Developed interview and webinar program to drive engagement with client projects. I also led the segmentation of a database containing 12,000 leads for a client.
#### Delivery
Executed multiple conferences with over 200 attendees and 20 sponsors. The planning and organization that went into these events will enable me to deliver software projects within the expected timeframe.
