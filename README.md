## Daniel Miller

I am a full stack developer who has just completed the makers academy bootcamp. In teams and independently I have created a variety of applications using object orientated ruby and javascript. I've prioritized writing simple and scalable back_end code, but am also able to create interactive web pages that will delight users. 

Prior to Makers I was running an events marketing and strategy consultancy. I set up the company whilst teaching english in Colombia. My work history shows my strong sense of initiative, ability to learn concepts quickly and my commitment to high quality work. 

Software development satisfies my desire for mental stimulation and challenge in a way that my previous career could not. My love of learning and ability to work as part of a team positions me to make an immediate and positive contribution to your company.
