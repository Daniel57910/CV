## DANIEL MILLER

Software Engineer at SG Digital. Began in the US Entry team and transitioned to the DevOps team where my main responsibility has been developing Python applications to automate and improve the release process. 

As part of this role I regularly provide in-office and out of hours support as the on-call DevOps team member, and have also enjoyed the additional responsibilities as a code reviewer. 

In addition I've recently completed the Udacity Data Engineering Nanodegree. Through the degree I've developed the ability to develop big data pipelines that can join hetrogenous datasets using distributed computing tools like spark.
